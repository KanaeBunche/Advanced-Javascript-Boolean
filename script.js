// Exercise: Comparison Operators Expertise

// Task 1:
// Create a function named `compareNumbers` that compares two numbers using comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, `!==`).
// Inside the function, declare two variables with number values and use comparison operators to compare them.

// Task 2:
// Create a function named `compareStrings` that compares two strings using comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===`, `!==`).
// Inside the function, declare two variables with string values and use comparison operators to compare them.

// Task 3:
// Create a function named `compareMixedTypes` that compares a number and a string using comparison operators.
// Inside the function, declare one variable with a number value and another with a string value, then use comparison operators to compare them.

// Task 4 (Bonus):
// Combine different comparison operators within a single expression to create complex conditions.
// Use comments to explain the purpose and expected result of each expression.

// Example:
// const result = (number1 > number2) || (string1 !== string2);
// // This expression checks if number1 is greater than number2 or if string1 is not equal to string2.

// Remember to test each function by calling them with different values and observing the output.
